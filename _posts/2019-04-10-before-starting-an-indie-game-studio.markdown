After my graduation as a software engineer, I decided to follow my childhood dream which is creating video games.

I started to test some game engines, make simple games and attend game events. Then I joined an indie game studio as a game programmer. And learned a lot throughout my journey in that company. It helped me realize the actual high risks in the gaming industry, what some mistakes to avoid and what I need to learn or do, to be able to succeed as an independent game developer.

One of the most critical aspects of getting your game successful, considering you built a great game, is how to make it stand out among the tremendous number of games that get published every day?

There are like a hundred games coming out of steam every day, and if you release a game today, you’re competing with a hundred other games for visibility. It’s difficult to get your games to stand out because you don’t get free promotion from similar platforms.

It’s my responsibility as a developer to sell the game and put in the work at marketing as a feature in the game itself. It’s not something to do afterward or wait for the game to be released to start marketing it. The earlier, the better.

So I decided to take the Digital Marketing Nanodegree Program from Udacity while working full time and apply it to my indie game studio before even the beginning of making the game. Hoping for your support during this solo journey while sharing my results to may inspire others whose dreams is to make a living from their passion.
